* Collaborate with the paid media team in executing and optimizing campaigns
* Craft client communications and output, including roadmap and reporting documents
* Coordinate workflows, deadlines, and deliverables among C&C team and freelancers
* Manage projects with grace and humility, ensuring all stays on point, on budget, and on time
* Consistently surface opportunities to add value to clients beyond immediate deliverables

**Requirements**

* 2-4 years experience within the client, agency or ad tech realms and a passion for / working knowledge of performance marketing writ large.
* Exceptionally organized, with a honed practice of managing multiple concurrent work streams across a variety of initiatives
* Stellar, efficient, clear written and oral communication skills
