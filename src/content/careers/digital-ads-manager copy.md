# Media Director

Craft & Commerce is dedicated to helping mission-driven marketers thrive in today’s complex, fast-evolving marketplace for attention. Our hands-on team of digital and paid media specialists delivers better, smarter marketing strategies that empower purposeful brands to amplify their storytelling and drive real-world results. We’re humbled that our clients have referred to us a “force multiplier” — not simply an agency resource, but a strategic thought partner and dot connector in navigating the modern media era.

We’re looking for a Media Director with a passion for efficacy, creativity, and innovation; a performance-first DNA, yet an integrated paid media skillset; a mastery of modern media planning and measurement; vision for client success and the ability to communicate a crisp, compelling POV; and the desire to ply your best-in-class skills and experience for the benefit of our purpose-driven partners.

You’ll collaborate directly with C&C’s co-founder, and will steward a team of paid media managers in delivering outsize results for C&C clients.

## Responsibilities:

**Media Strategy, Planning, and Innovation**

* Lead multiple accounts across integrated paid media strategy, planning and buying  
  Internalize clients needs, opportunities, and challenges to formulate measurable, outcomes-focused media strategies that demonstrate a mastery of the client, the audience, and the attention landscape
* Translate strategy into a modern, measurable media plan that showcases creativity, efficiency, and results
* Passionately represent strategy and planning among both agency and client-side stakeholders, providing informed POVs and collaborative iteration in response to feedback
* Set a high bar for insight, efficacy, and professionalism that earns client trust and inspires team respect
* Maintain leading-edge expertise on attention trends and media platform innovations, and positive working relationships with vendors in the community

**Campaign Leadership and Performance Optimization**

* Vigilantly monitor campaign performance, pacing, and costs against goals, taking ownership of and ensuring campaign success
* Continually and proactively surface opportunities for optimization, as well as outliers and red flags in the data, getting out in front of both
* Manage a team of performance and integrated paid media managers in executing, optimizing, and reporting upon buys, ensuring accurate, on-time delivery and campaign measurement
* Create actionable insight from campaign data, providing valuable thought leadership during regular client check-ins and beyond
* Lead the creation of campaign recap reports and go-forward recommendations, with a distaste for vanity metrics, a passion to surface the tactics that truly powered client success, and a forward-looking vision for how our partners can scale their impact

**Client and Team Stewardship**

* Train, mentor, and develop your team of paid media managers, continually elevating their skillset and POV on our clients’ business and media trends writ large
* Lay out a vision for team growth and manage existing team performance, as well as new hire interviewing and onboarding, accordingly
* Manage up to C&C’s Co-Founder and Campaign Lead, thoughtfully presenting client media strategies, surfacing issues, and collaborating on campaign optimization and client growth
* Maintain the workload of the paid media team across multiple client accounts, delegating tasks and monitoring individual responsibilities to ensure the most effective deployment of team capital
* Maintain deep, timely perspective of client business across the C&C roster, including relevant media or attention trends, case studies, and sector-specific news
* Manage the overall efficiency and efficacy of C&C’s paid media systems, tools, and processes, regularly auditing and optimizing as-needed
* Regularly contribute sharp, paid media POV to new business proposals and participate in business development conversations and pitch meetings

  ## Requirements:
* At least 8 years experience as a paid media strategist and planner, with a proven track record of delivering meaningful client outcomes and stewarding integrated paid media campaigns to success
* At least 4 years experience leading and managing a paid media team, training early to mid-career professionals, installing systems, processes, and tools, and setting a vision for team and client success
* DNA as a performance marketer, but full command of integrated media suite including: paid social and search, programmatic buying, linear, convergent, and advanced TV buying, digital audio, and custom content partnerships
* Strong track record of client loyalty and trust, going beyond media execution to serve as a strategic advisor to client-side stakeholders
* Exceptional, best-in-class written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to communicate effectively across all levels of team, client, and agency / vendor partners
* Demonstrated ability to write and deliver concise, well-reasoned, and inspired media presentations, and present to clients effectively and confidently
* Leading-edge understanding of audience attention and media engagement research sources, methods, and use in the planning process
* Leading-edge understanding of media measurement tools and attribution models
* Strong “media math” and analytical skills, with a supernatural ability to zoom above the data and spot actionable trends
* Skilled negotiator, with a track record of delivering efficient outcomes for clients while maintaining fair, collaborative relationships with media vendors
* Obsessive attention to detail
