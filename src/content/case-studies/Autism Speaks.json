  "campaignDescription": "Too often, donor audiences experience a nonprofit through an onslaught of transactional, “give now” appeals that do little to build a brand relationship, or—in the case of Autism Speaks—deliver upon its mission of increasing understanding and acceptance of those with autism. C&C partnered with Autism Speaks to elevate this donor dialogue across the organization’s 15th anniversary brand relaunch, its Year of Kindness call-to-action, World Autism Month, and End of Year Giving. Together, we forged a new, story-driven approach to the organization’s marketing and deployed an integrated, cross-platform campaign that engaged donor audiences in video and written storytelling across social media, traditional and streaming TV, native advertising, radio, print, and out-of-home. This brand-building foundation resulted in a double-digit lift in key downstream measurables including pledges, birthday fundraisers, and year-end gifts.",
