C&C partnered with MacArthur to spread the news of 100&Change among those working on frontlines of our biggest challenges globally, and, moreover, to deploy focused outreach to the underrepresented innovators of Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia—far exceeding period-over-period benchmarks for proposal volume, quality, and diversity.",
