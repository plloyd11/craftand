  "campaignDescription": "National Cooperative Bank challenges the banking status quo by offering customers not just competitive rates, but a commitment to community impact. However, delivering this mission-driven message in the hypercompetitive financial services marketplace is no easy task. To validate an effective customer acquisition strategy, C&C took a market-by-market approach, delivering a one-two punch of upper funnel storytelling through podcast advertising and lower funnel search, remarketing, and landing page optimization to capture and convert demand. The result is a digital funnel that fuels sustainable, scaled growth for NCB.",
