With this mission in mind, C&C worked in close collaboration with the Girl Scouts marketing team to scale the organizationâ€™s new member recruitment funnel, engaging diverse communities of girls and their parents across platforms including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and search, reinvigorating messaging and creative, strategically amplifying messages among Spanish-speaking communities and in council locations with the greatest capacity, and ultimately building an optimized lead-generation model that helped Girl Scouts to double its new member growth year-over-year.",
