  "campaignDescription": "The New Americans Campaign is a nationwide effort to inspire lawful permanent residents to take the first step toward U.S. citizenship. With communities awash in fear and misinformation, the campaignâ€™s success hinges not only upon informing a hard-to-reach population, but also in striking the right balance of tone, imagery, and language across diverse audiences. Through deep collaboration with on-the-ground stakeholders, coupled with an integrated, culturally-attuned media plan and rigorous testing, learning, and optimization, C&C pioneered an outreach model that effectively meets immigrant communities where they are and helps to deliver generational impact.",
